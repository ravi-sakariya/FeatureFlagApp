**How to run it:**

    **API**
    It is .Net core(8.0) Web API project so you can just run from cli or visual studio and verify from swagger at below service URL:
    You will see different endpoints and also I have added working enpoint screen shot along with repo for your reference only.
      **https://localhost:7189/swagger/index.html**
    
    **Database:**
    I also provide provided Microsoft SQL script (Script.sql) to create database and table to read/write feature flag details.


**What you’d do next with another hour/day**
Honestly I can not complete this excerice in 120 Minutes. It takes more time to complete phase 2.
Note: My provided code solution is not complete.
I can complete this accurately withing a or 2 days.
Unit test also remaining to create.

**Known limitations / rough edges**
There is always scope to improve code and ultimetly it improve performace as well.
We can use read only DB context.
We can improve DB schema because it is not production ready schema.

**AI Tool**
In given time honestly I can not complete this wihtout help of AI tool.
I take help of copilot to take some code snippet and made changes as per requirement.
